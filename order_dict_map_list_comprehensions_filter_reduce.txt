reduce:
the key function gets passed the first 2 elemtents of the iterable and executes.
If the iterable has only one element reduce returns it without calling the key function.

map, reduce or filter when operate on a dict, the keys are the items.
To act upon the k,v use dict.iteritems and in this case a tupe (k, v) gets passed.

An collections.OrderedDict takes its' parameter just like if they were kwargs:
OrderedDict(one=1, param='go knows')
