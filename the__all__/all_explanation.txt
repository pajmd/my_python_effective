The __all__ = ['object', 'module'] makes it possible to export the particular listed objects or modules so
a mobule importing using the forms (notice the single quoted list):
- from some_package import *  ( __init__.py would contain the __all__ = [...]
- from some module import *   ( the module.py would contain the __all__ = [...]
would see only the exported objects or modules
